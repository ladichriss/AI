                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human
                        intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require
                        human intelligence or intervention.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines 
                        "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking 
                        power." </p>

                    <p class="Paragraph">So, we can define AI as a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent 
                        machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.</p>

                        • Gaming: AI plays crucial role in strategic games (chess, poker, etc.) where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge. <br>
                        • Natural language processing: AI can read the input information insert by user and give him an answer <br>
                        • Speech recognition: Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language while a human talks to it. <br>

                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial Intelligence can be created using various coding languages.
                        The most obvious one is Python, but other languages can be used such as C++ because of how 
                        flexible it is, Java for mobile apps development, Lisp and R for crunching large numbers.
                        There are also many languages not suitable for AI development, for example, scripting languages, 
                        such as Perl and JavaScript. </p>

                    <p class="Paragraph">The first AI was created by Alan Turing in 1950.
                        In the Turing Test, a human evaluator engages in a natural language conversation with both a human 
                        and a machine (typically through text-based communication). The evaluator does not know which is 
                        which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish which responses are coming from the human and 
                        which are coming from the machine, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="Paragraph">The first actual artificial intelligence prototypes date back to the 1950s, when they could only solve algebra problems.
                        An important moment was the Darmouth Conference in 1956, where the term Artificial Intelligence was officially confirmed as a new field of research.
                        After AI continued to develop, much more slowly, for the lack of the tools necessary for research.
                        This is changing in recent years, now with more advanced tools, AI can be developed in various ways, slowly entering in our life.</p>
