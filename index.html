                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human
                        intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require
                        human intelligence or intervention.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines 
                        "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking 
                        power." </p>

                    <p class="Paragraph">So, we can define AI as, "It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent 
                        machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions."</p>

                        • Gaming: AI plays crucial role in strategic games (chess, poker…) where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge. <br>
                        • Natural language processing: AI can read the input information insert by user and give him an answer <br>
                        • Speech recognition: Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language while a human talks to it. <br>

                    <p class="Paragraph">Artificial Intelligence can be created using various coding languages.
                        The most obvious one is Python, but other languages can be used such as C++ because of how 
                        flexible it is, Java for mobile apps development, Lisp and R for crunching large numbers.
                        There are also many languages not suitable for AI development, for example, scripting languages, 
                        such as Perl and JavaScript. </p>

                    <p class="Paragraph">However, it's important to note that the development of AI involved contributions from many 
                        researchers over several decades. Some of the earliest work in AI dates back to the 1940s and 
                        1950s, with notable figures such as Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test in 1950.
                        The Turing Test is a method proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan 
                        Turing in 1950 to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or 
                        indistinguishable from, that of a human.
                        In the Turing Test, a human evaluator engages in a natural language conversation with both a human 
                        and a machine (typically through text-based communication). The evaluator does not know which is 
                        which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish which responses are coming from the human and 
                        which are coming from the machine, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="Paragraph">The first actual AI programs can be traced to as far back as the 1950s where they were able to play 
                        checkers and solve algebra problems.
                        A pivotal moment was the Darmouth Conference 1956, where the term was officially coined.
                        After that, AI continued to develop, although not that quickly, because of the lack of the necessary 
                        means for research.
                        This is changing in recent years, as our technology is advancing, AI is coming in full-swing and 
                        developing like never before, now it is much more advanced and can be used in a variety of ways, 
                        making both small and big contributions in our lives.</p>
